To generate hyperlinks for question papers in the context of the Question Bank Software, you can follow these steps:

### Process to Generate Hyperlinks

1. **Question Selection**: Allow trainers to select questions from the question bank based on subject, topic, and difficulty level.

2. **Paper Generation**: Create a question paper in HTML format that includes the selected questions.

3. **Link Creation**: Store the generated HTML paper on a server or cloud storage and create a unique URL for accessing it.

4. **Set Expiration**: Implement a mechanism to set an expiration time for the hyperlink, ensuring it becomes invalid after a specified duration.

5. **Distribute Link**: Share the hyperlink with employees via email or other communication channels.

6. **Access and Submission**: Employees access the hyperlink, complete the questions, and submit their answers.

### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a simple example using C# to generate a hyperlink for a question paper:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public class QuestionPaperGenerator
{
    public string GenerateQuestionPaper(string[] questions, TimeSpan validDuration)
    {
        // Create HTML content for the question paper
        string htmlContent = "<html><body><h1>Question Paper</h1><ol>";
        foreach (var question in questions)
        {
            htmlContent += $"<li>{question}</li>";
        }
        htmlContent += "</ol></body></html>";

        // Save the HTML to a file
        string fileName = $"QuestionPaper_{Guid.NewGuid()}.html";
        File.WriteAllText(fileName, htmlContent);

        // Generate a unique URL (for demonstration, using a local path)
        string uniqueUrl = $"http://yourserver.com/{fileName}";

        // Set expiration time (for example, 1 hour from now)
        DateTime expirationTime = DateTime.Now.Add(validDuration);
        
        // Store expiration logic (this would typically involve a database)
        StoreLinkExpiration(uniqueUrl, expirationTime);

        return uniqueUrl;
    }

    private void StoreLinkExpiration(string url, DateTime expirationTime)
    {
        // Logic to store the URL and its expiration time in a database or cache
        Console.WriteLine($"Stored URL: {url} with expiration time: {expirationTime}");
    }
}

// Example usage
var generator = new QuestionPaperGenerator();
string[] questions = { "What is the capital of France?", "What is 2 + 2?" };
string link = generator.GenerateQuestionPaper(questions, TimeSpan.FromHours(1));
Console.WriteLine("Access your question paper at: " + link);
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **HTML Generation**: The code creates an HTML document containing the selected questions.
- **File Handling**: It saves the HTML file with a unique name to avoid conflicts.
- **URL Creation**: A unique URL is generated for the question paper.
- **Expiration Logic**: The expiration time is calculated, and a placeholder method (`StoreLinkExpiration`) is used to represent storing this information, which would typically involve a database.
- **Output**: Finally, the generated link is printed for access. 

This process ensures that each question paper is easily accessible for a limited time, enhancing the security and integrity of the assessment process.
